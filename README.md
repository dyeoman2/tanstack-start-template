## üöÄ Setup Guide

[![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Use%20this%20template-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/dyeoman2/tanstack-start-template/generate)

This creates a fresh copy of the codebase in your GitHub account.

### One-Click Deploy to Netlify (Production)

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start)

**What happens automatically:**

- Connect your GitHub account
- Select your new repository
- Netlify builds and deploys your app
- Sets up automatic deployments on every push

**Required Setup Steps:**

1. **Convex Deployment:**
   - Create a Convex project: `npx convex dev` (follow prompts)
   - Get your Production Deploy Key from Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Deploy Keys
   - Add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` to Netlify environment variables

2. **Convex Environment Variables:**
   - In your Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables, add:
     - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
     - `SITE_URL` (your Netlify site URL: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`)
     - `RESEND_API_KEY` (your Resend API key)
     - `RESEND_EMAIL_SENDER` (your verified sender email)
     - `APP_NAME` (your application name)

3. **Netlify Environment Variables:**
   - Add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` (from Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Deploy Keys ‚Üí Production)

**‚úÖ FREE TIER** - No credit card required. Uses Netlify's free tier + Convex free tier.

**Note:** Authentication and email configuration is handled entirely in Convex. You do NOT need to set these in Netlify environment variables.

That's it! Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

### Local Setup (Development)

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm
- [Convex CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart) (`npx convex`)

##### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd tanstack-start-template

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up development environment (creates .env.local with required secrets)
pnpm run setup

# Initialize Convex (follow prompts to create your project)
npx convex dev

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

#### Convex Setup

The setup script will guide you through:

1. **Convex Project Creation**: Creates your Convex project
2. **Environment Variables**: Sets up `VITE_CONVEX_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
3. **Database Schema**: Automatically deploys your Convex schema

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and Convex dashboard at the URL provided during setup.
