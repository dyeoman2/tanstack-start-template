## 🚀 Setup Guide

### ⚡ Quick Start (Local Development)

1. **[Create your repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=tanstack-start-template&template_owner=dyeoman2)** from this template

2. **Clone your new repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```

3. **Run the automated setup**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run setup:dev
   ```

This automated script will guide you through local development setup, including:

- Interactive Convex project creation
- Development environment configuration (URLs and environment variables)
- Optional authenticated Playwright E2E setup via `pnpm run setup:e2e`
- Automatic startup of both development servers simultaneously in the current terminal!

### 🚀 Quick Start (Production)

**Automated Production Setup** (Recommended):

```bash
# After completing local development setup
pnpm run setup:prod
```

**What happens automatically:**

- ✅ Checks for git remote repository
- ✅ Deploys Convex functions to production
- ✅ Provides step-by-step Netlify deployment instructions
- ✅ Pre-fills environment variables for easy copying
- ✅ Guides you through connecting your existing repository

**🎉 Result:** Your app will be live with authentication, database, and real-time features!

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit and component tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Browser E2E with Playwright

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

Playwright uses the real local app at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and starts a frontend-only server with `pnpm test:e2e:server`. It reuses your configured Convex deployment from env instead of starting `convex dev`.

Authenticated E2E relies on a gated test-only auth helper. The easiest setup path is:

```bash
pnpm setup:e2e
```

That command updates `.env.local` with deterministic E2E principals and syncs the required gate vars to your current Convex deployment automatically. If you prefer to manage the values manually, add these values to `.env.local` before running authenticated suites:

```bash
ENABLE_E2E_TEST_AUTH=true
E2E_TEST_SECRET=replace-with-a-shared-secret
E2E_USER_EMAIL=e2e-user@local.test
E2E_USER_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-deterministic-password
E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL=e2e-admin@local.test
E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-deterministic-password
```

The setup project will provision those principals, reconcile the Convex role profile, and save `playwright/.auth/user.json` and `playwright/.auth/admin.json` automatically.

Because the frontend test server reuses your configured Convex deployment, that deployment must also have:

```bash
ENABLE_E2E_TEST_AUTH=true
E2E_TEST_SECRET=the-same-shared-secret
```

`pnpm setup:e2e` handles that sync for the current deployment. You only need to set those deployment vars manually if you are not using the setup script.

### 🔗 Link Your Local Project to Netlify (Optional)

After deploying, link your local project to Netlify for easier management:

```bash
# Link your local project to the deployed Netlify site
npx netlify link

# This allows you to:
# - Deploy updates with `npx netlify deploy --prod`
# - View build logs locally
# - Manage environment variables from CLI
```

## 📄 Third Party Services Setup

In order to send password reset and transactional emails, you need to set up Resend. In order to monitor errors and performance, you need to set up Sentry. For AI functionality, you need to set up Cloudflare Workers AI. To meter usage and offer paid upgrades after the 10 free messages, you need to set up Autumn. For web scraping and content extraction in the AI playground, you can set up Firecrawl. These are optional, but recommended for production.
